Yes, you can call `cargo check` programmatically from a Rust script to create a CLI app that helps with programming. There are a few ways to accomplish this:

1. Using `std::process::Command`:
   This is the most straightforward method to run external commands in Rust.

   ```rust
   use std::process::Command;

   fn main() {
       let output = Command::new("cargo")
           .arg("check")
           .output()
           .expect("Failed to execute cargo check");

       if output.status.success() {
           println!("Cargo check passed successfully");
       } else {
           eprintln!("Cargo check failed");
           eprintln!("{}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stderr));
       }
   }
   ```

2. Using the `cargo` crate:
   There's a crate specifically for interacting with Cargo programmatically. First, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   cargo = "0.67.0"
   ```

   Then you can use it in your code:

   ```rust
   use cargo::core::Workspace;
   use cargo::ops;
   use cargo::util::Config;

   fn main() {
       let config = Config::default().unwrap();
       let workspace = Workspace::new(
           &std::path::PathBuf::from(".").canonicalize().unwrap(),
           &config
       ).unwrap();

       let options = ops::CompileOptions::new(&config, ops::CompileMode::Check { test: false }).unwrap();
       match ops::compile(&workspace, &options) {
           Ok(_) => println!("Cargo check passed successfully"),
           Err(e) => eprintln!("Cargo check failed: {}", e),
       }
   }
   ```

3. Using the `duct` crate:
   This crate provides a more convenient API for running external commands. Add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   duct = "0.13.6"
   ```

   Then use it in your code:

   ```rust
   use duct::cmd;

   fn main() {
       match cmd!("cargo", "check").run() {
           Ok(_) => println!("Cargo check passed successfully"),
           Err(e) => eprintln!("Cargo check failed: {}", e),
       }
   }
   ```

Each of these methods allows you to run `cargo check` programmatically. Choose the one that best fits your needs based on the level of control and integration you require for your CLI app.

Remember to handle potential errors and provide appropriate feedback to the user of your CLI app.

Yes, you can call `cargo check` from a Rust script using the `cargo` crate. Here's the most succinct code to do this:

```rust
use cargo::ops;
use cargo::core::Workspace;
use cargo::util::Config;

fn main() -> cargo::util::errors::CargoResult<()> {
    let config = Config::default()?;
    let ws = Workspace::new(&std::env::current_dir()?.join("Cargo.toml"), &config)?;
    ops::compile(&ws, &ops::CompileOptions::new(&config, ops::CompileMode::Check { test: false })?)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

This code initializes a Cargo configuration, creates a workspace from the current directory's `Cargo.toml`, and then runs the equivalent of `cargo check` using the `ops::compile` function.

Note that you'll need to add the `cargo` crate to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
cargo = "0.67.0"
```

Remember that the `cargo` crate's API is not stable and may change in future versions.
